Git:

1.what is git conflict & how to resolve it.

when we merge two different branches haveing the same name file but total diff content then conflict occure.
actually git get confused which data have to place above & which data have to place lower.

how to resolve it.
just open the file and do some edit and save the file.



2.diff b/w entrypoint & command
Lets create a  dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
CMD echo "hi docker"

docker build -t app .
docker run -it app

hi docker

If we want pass the arrgument at run time then it will replace the cmd comand in dockerfile.
docker run -it app echo "hi aws"

hi aws

So conclusion is CMD command can be replaced with creating the container with passing CMD arrgument.


Question> can we use multiple CMD command in dockerfile:

eg. vi dockerfile

FROM ubuntu
CMD echo "hi aws"
CMD echo "hi python"

docker build -t app .
docker run -it app 

hi python

Now we can see the first CMD command is ignord & last command is run.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["echo","Hi docker"]
docker build - t app .

docker run -it app 

Hi docker

If we pass the arrgument at run time

docker run -it app echo "Hi python"

Hi docker echo Hi python

Here we can see, entrypoint command is not replaced it get appended.

So CMD & ENTRYPOINT both ae used to execute some process at container run time.
cmd command can be replaced but entrypint point command can not. it can be appended.


3.git fetch vs pull.

git fetch bascially fetch the latest updates from remote repo to local repo it donot mearge with working area.
git pull fetch the latest update & merage with the working area.
git pull = fetch + merage

Diff b/w git reset & git revert

git reset: when we add the code in stageing area then we want to push back it in working are then we use git reset

git revert: if we add the commit the code and then we push back in working area then we use git revert, once we revert it, it creates a new commit.

Instance Launch Type:

On-demand: shot  workload costing in sec
Reserve: reserve b/w 1-3 yr
schdeule-instance: This is similar to reserved instances in that you reserve them between 1 to 3 years. However, with scheduled reserved instances you also must define the time of day, week, or month you want the instance to be available. If you need the instance to only be available between 1:00 PM and 4:00 PM on Tuesdays, then that is the only time the instance will be available to you.
spot-instance: Spot instances are unused EC2 capacity that you bid on when they become available. They are the cheapest of the available launch types. 
dedicated-host: Dedicated hosts allow you to book an entire physical server and control the placement of the instance. You will gain full visibility into the underlying sockets and cores.
